Functions return: a copy of array or the view

Copy: when the contents are physically stored in another location
View: A different view of the the same memory

id() - universal identifier of python object. Similar to pointer in C

Change in shape one will make a change in the other (view)

See example in NumPy/copies_and_views.py
- slicing an array creates a view

------------------------------------------------------------
Encapsulation: it is that things are protected inside of a class or object and cannot be easily manipulated by outside
 - in python an underscore denotes a private member or method
    __private_method__
    _private_member

Abstraction: a class that can be used as a base and then added to to better suit a situation or context. Parent could be an abstraction of the class Person

Polymorphism: to have different methods for handling different types and to override other methods for specific classes
